As a new computing paradigm,cloud computing offers ubiquitous and ondemand
access to flexible computation and storage resources. Therefore, outsourcing local data to
cloud servers has become a common practice for enterprises and individuals. While this
measure greatly reduces hardware and maintenance expenditure, data owners actually lose
direct control over their data. This certainly has brought some security concerns, especially to
owners of highly sensitive data (i.e., electronic medical records, financial documents, etc.).
With such suspicion, individuals and enterprises may be reluctant to outsource their sensitive
data to an untrusted third-party cloud service provider. Thus, security concerns will become
one of the primary obstacles impeding the widespread deployments of cloud computing.
